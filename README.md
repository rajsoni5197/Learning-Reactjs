# Tick-Tack-Toe.

This repo is a part of my reactJs learning process.

## Run it in your local computer.
To run it in your computer first clone this repo and then type the following command in the commandprompt:

###   1.  `npm install` or `npm i`
        This will install the required npm packeges mentioned in packege.json file.

###   2.   `npm start`
        This will start your Reactjs server on port 3000.

# Happy Learning :slightly_smiling_face:.
